                Welcome to <b>Blissful Moments</b> – where each candle tells a story, and every scent brings you closer to serenity.
                We’re not just about wax and wicks — we’re about creating <b>moments of peace, joy, and connection</b> in a fast-moving world.
                Whether it’s the warm glow during your evening unwind, the gentle fragrance that calms a busy mind, or the thoughtful gift that makes someone’s day — our candles are made to spark something special.

                <h3 align="left">Our Story</h3>
                <br>
                Blissful Moments was born out of a simple idea: to turn everyday routines into beautiful rituals. 
                What started as a small passion project grew into a heartfelt mission — to handcraft candles that bring light, comfort, and mindfulness into your space.
                <br>
                Inspired by nature, emotions, and everyday beauty, we blend high-quality soy wax, clean fragrances, and elegant designs to craft pieces that are as aesthetic as they are aromatic.
                <br></br>
                My love for technology extends to programming, where I thrive on building creative and functional projects. 
                Beyond coding, I’m a creative soul who finds inspiration in sketching. For me, sketching is more than just 
                a hobby—it’s a way to express emotions and capture the beauty of the world around me. With every pencil stroke, 
                I aim to bring ideas to life on paper, whether it’s a realistic portrait or an imaginative design.
